# Mayvue Tech Challenge
 
*Please begin the test, track your time, and send your answers back to me as soon as the test is completed.

 

The instructions are listed below:

 

 

1.       Create a webpage that has the following features:

A textbox

A text/label that updates to show the contents of the textbox.

If there are more than 20 characters in the textbox, the border color of the textbox should change to red.

A button labeled ’Click Me’  

Text/label that tracks the number of times the button was clicked.

 

Constraints:

Must use ECMAScript 6 (ES6) module containing a class. (compatible browsers: https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module)

May NOT use any inline JavaScript.

May NOT use jQuery.

May use a full Visual Studio solution, or simply an index.html and javascript file, or using codepen, etc.

Bonus points for creative styling.

 

Tip: ES6 Modules can’t be loaded from the filesystem, so you have to have the files served by a web server to test.

 

2. This is an old analysis that we’ve been using for nearly a decade.  It’s old legacy Baker Pontis code so it’s really not good, simple request...  The file attached entitled ‘property.txt’ is an example snippet of a property.  I’d like for you to quickly analyze it, tell me what it’s doing, any suggestions for enhancement, and any potential problems or pitfalls with it.
